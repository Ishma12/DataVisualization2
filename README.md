#Statistical Interpretation and Data Visualization
This project analyzes student performance data from two Portuguese secondary schools. The dataset, loaded using pandas, includes quantitative data on student achievements, demographics, and social factors. Initial data cleaning involves checking for null values and transforming categorical variables into binary and ordinal formats. The age variable is converted into intervals, and a new column is created to indicate whether students passed based on their final grade. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation are calculated for key variables. Various visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, bar graphs, and pie charts, are employed to explore the distribution of age, absences, and grades, as well as the relationship between school, parental occupation, and student performance.

#Image Compression Using Principal Component Analysis
In the provided file, the steps involve loading a grayscale image, standardizing its pixel data, calculating a covariance matrix to understand pixel intensity relationships, performing eigen decomposition to identify principal components capturing maximum variance, and finally reconstructing the image using these components to observe varying levels of detail retention. This process effectively condenses the image data while preserving essential information, aiding in tasks such as compression and feature extraction in image analysis and processing.
